# Basic Password Manager
The Basic Password Manager is a lightweight application designed to securely store and manage your passwords. This project ensures privacy through the implementation of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), ensuring that even the app itself cannot access your master password. Key features include:

+ Master Password Protection: Access to the password vault is secured with a master password verified through a ZKP mechanism, ensuring no one, including the system, knows the password.
+ Password Storage: Store your passwords securely in an encrypted format. Each password is associated with specific accounts or services, making retrieval easy and efficient.
 + Encryption: Uses strong encryption to protect stored passwords from unauthorized access.
 
This project focuses on maintaining security without sacrificing ease of use, making it ideal for individuals seeking to manage their passwords effectively and privately.
